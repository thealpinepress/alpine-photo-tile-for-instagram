# About

*We at the Alpine Press strive to create plugins that are stylish, well-programmed, highly customizable, and intuitive to use.  These may seem like  simple objectives, but theyâ€™re surprisingly complicated to achieve in unison.  We understand that you use WordPress to create a unique online experience for yourself and your visitors. As a result, many of our plugin features may be turned on and off at your discretion, making our products truly yours.  We hope you like our work and find our website helpful and engaging.*

**The Alpine Press plugins have been originally developed by Eric Burger & Kylin Navarro.**

Since end of 2019 a new team formed consisting of Paul Petershagen & Gangesh Matta to re-launch the plugins in a updated version.
